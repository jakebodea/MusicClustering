I can sing when I lose my step and fall down again
I can sing cause You pick me up sing cause You’re there
I can sing cause You hear me Lord when I call to You in prayer
I can sing with my last breath sing for I know
That I’ll sing with the angels and the saints around the throne

Din apă şi din foc să mă scape El poate, 
Dar eu nu mă tem, dar eu nu mă tem.

I keep trying to find a life

On my own, apart from you

I am the king of excuses

Pre-Chorus :

    F          G       Am
I despise my own behavior
